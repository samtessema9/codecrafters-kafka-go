This is my solution to the
["Build Your Own Kafka" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/kafka).

In this challenge, I'll be building build a toy Kafka clone that's capable of accepting
and responding to APIVersions & Fetch API requests. I'll be learning about and implementing a subset of the Kafka Wire Protocol in order to achieve this.
